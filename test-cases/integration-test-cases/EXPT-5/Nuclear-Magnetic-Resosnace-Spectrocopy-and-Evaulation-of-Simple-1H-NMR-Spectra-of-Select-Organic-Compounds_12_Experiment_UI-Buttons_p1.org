* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the "Click Here" link 
  2. Check the functionality of the "UI Buttons".

* Expected result
  1. Experiment page should be displayed on the screen
  2. "Sample" button, On click, the UI buttons for the solutions
     should be appeared. 
  3. "Solution" buttons, on click the sample should get loaded in to
     the sample cavity. The solution in the sample cavity should get changed according to
     the selection of the solution. 
  4. "Load Sample" button, on click, the sample cavity should gets
     placed in to the magnetic field. 
  5. "Start" button, on click, the experiment should get started. 
  6. "Plot" button, on click, the graph on the experiment screen
     should be activated.
  5. "Evaluate" button, On click a graphical representation should be opened in a new tab.
