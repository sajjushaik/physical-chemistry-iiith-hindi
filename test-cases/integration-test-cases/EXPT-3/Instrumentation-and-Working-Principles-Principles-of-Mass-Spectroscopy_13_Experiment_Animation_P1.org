* Objective
  - To view the Experiment of "Instrumentation and Working Principles Principles of Mass Spectroscopy"

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/physical-chemistry-iiith/blob/master/test-cases/integration-test-cases/EXPT-3/Instrumentation-and-Working-Principles-Principles-of-Mass-Spectroscopy_01_Usability_smk.org][Instrumentation-and-Working-Principles-Principles-of-Mass-Spectroscopy_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the "Click Here" link 
  2. Check whether the Animations are created accordingly and
     performing with out any distortions.

* Expected result
  1. Experiment page should be displayed on the screen
  2. Animation should be present with out any distortions while the
     sample is introduced into the vaporization chamber.
  3. An Arrow should be pointed towards the tube lid.
  4. Animation for the molecules.
  5. Animations for ions.
  6. Animations for positively charged ions.
  7. Animation for the ions that are sorted and separated by the
     magnetic field.
