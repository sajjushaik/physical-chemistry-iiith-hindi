* Test Steps
  1. Click on the "Click Here" link 
  2. Check the functionality of the UI buttons.

* Expected result
  1. Experiment page should be displayed on the screen
  2. "Load Sample" button - On click The sample should be introduced
     into the vaporisation chamber.
  3. "Ionization" button - On click Positively charged radical ions
     should be formed.
  4. "Acceleration" button - On click positively charged radical ions
     should be accelerated by perforated negative electrodes.
  5. "Deflection" button - On click The ions should be sorted and
     separted by the magnetic field according to their mass/ charge
     ratio.
  6. "Evaluation" button - On click A new tab should be opened with
     the graphical representation with the desired results.
