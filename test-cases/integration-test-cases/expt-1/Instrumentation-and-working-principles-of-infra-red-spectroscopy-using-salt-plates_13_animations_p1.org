* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the appropriate buttons accordingly. 
  2. Check whether the Animations are created accordingly and
     performing with out any distortions.

* Expected result
  1. Experiment page should be displayed on the screen
  2. Animation should be present with out any distortions while the
     sample is introduced into the vaporization chamber.
  3. An Arrow should be pointed towards the jars and sample lids.
  4. Animation for the Meter.
  5. Animations for Graph should be present.
