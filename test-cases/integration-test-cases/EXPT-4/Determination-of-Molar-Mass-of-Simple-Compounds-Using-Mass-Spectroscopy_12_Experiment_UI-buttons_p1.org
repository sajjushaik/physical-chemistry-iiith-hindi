* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the "Click Here" link 
  2. Check the functionality of the "UI Buttons".

* Expected result
  1. Experiment page should be displayed on the screen
  2. On click, the sample should be selected when needed. 
  3. The UI buttons for "Aspirine" and "2-Nitrophenol" solutions will be disappeared once the desired solution is
     selected. 
  4. The functionality of other objects should not be performed with out selecting the solvent type.
  5. "Evaluate" button, On click a graphical representation should be opened in a new tab.
