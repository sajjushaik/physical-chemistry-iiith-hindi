* Test Steps
  1. Click on the "Click Here" link 
  2. Check the functionality of the "Empty" container.

* Expected result
  1. Experiment page should be displayed on the screen
  2. On click the Sample from sample container and solvent container
     should be dropped in to the empty container. 
  3. On click the container should mix the solutions. 
  4. On click prepared solution should be collected with an
     instrument. 
  5. The collected sollution should be inserted in to the Mass
     Spectrometer.
