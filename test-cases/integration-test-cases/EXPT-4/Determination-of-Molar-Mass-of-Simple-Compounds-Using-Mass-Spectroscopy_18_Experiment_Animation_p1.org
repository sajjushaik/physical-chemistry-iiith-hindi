* Environment

  +  OS: Windows 7, Linux
  +  Browsers: Firefox,Chrome
  +  Bandwidth : 100Mbps
  +  Hardware Configuration:8GBRAM,
  +  Processor:i5

* Objective

  +  To view the Objective of "Determination of Molar Mass of Simple Compounds Using Mass Spectroscopy" experiment.

* Pre conditions

  +  Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/physical-chemistry-iiith/blob/master/test-cases/integration-test-cases/EXPT-4/Determination-of-Molar-Mass-of-Simple-Compounds-Using-Mass-Spectroscopy_01_Usability_smk.org][Determination-of-Molar-Mass-of-Simple-Compounds-Using-Mass-Spectroscopy_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions

  +  Nil

* Test Steps

  +  Click on the "Click here" link
  +  Check whether all the animations are created as desired/existed.

* Expected result

   1. A new tab with the experiment should be opened. 
   2. Animation should be present when the sample is collected from the Solvent
      container.
   3. Animation should be present when the sample is transferred from
      Sample container to empty container.
   4. Animation should be present when we try to mix the solution once
      the sample is poured in to an empty container. 
   5. Animation should be present when the solution is collected from
      the "Sample Bottle".
   6. Animation should be present when the sample is injected in to the
      sample inlet. This animation should be repeated again when we try
      to inject the solution for the experiment. 
   7. Animation should be present for the inner procedure of the
      spectrometer. 
   8. Animations for ions should be present.
   9. Animations for the instruments that collects the sample and the
      solution should be present. 
  10. Animation for the arrow mark should be present.
  11. All the above animations should present with out any
      distortions.
